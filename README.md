# HC-TCG Bot
 This is a discord bot designed for the hermitcraft tcg online server. It has commands that can be used for many things such as deck viewing, card information, admin commands for http://hc-tcg.fly.dev and more.

## Running
 to install dependencies, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

 I recommend first running [update_data.py](/update_data.py) to create a static universe. This will allow the bot to start quickly. To start the actual bot run [main.py](/main.py)

## Formatting
For formatting I use ruff, you can access the configuration in ruff.toml
